# EEG-Classification-Model

In this project, you will build a classification model to analyze EEG data and classify it into
different categories. EEG data is widely used in neuroscience and medical fields, including the
diagnosis of epilepsy. You will be using two EEG datasets to train and evaluate your model.
Datasets:
1. CHB-MIT EEG Database </br>
This dataset contains EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy. It includes
various seizure types and non-seizure data.
2. Bonn EEG Dataset </br>
This dataset contains EEG recordings with a focus on epileptic seizures.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:</br>
o Download and extract the datasets.
o Explore the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
o If necessary, preprocess the EEG data, including handling missing values, noise
reduction, and data augmentation.
2. Feature Extraction:</br>
o Extract relevant features from the EEG signals. You may consider time-domain and
frequency-domain features.
3. Data Splitting:</br>
o Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
4. Model Selection:</br>
o Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for EEG
classification. Consider models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
5. Model Training:</br>
o Train your chosen model on the training data using appropriate training techniques.
o Implement strategies to avoid overfitting, such as dropout or early stopping.
6. Model Evaluation:</br>
o Evaluate your model's performance on the validation set using relevant evaluation
metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
o Fine-tune hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
7. Testing:</br>
o Assess the final model on the test set to ensure its generalization capability.
8. Results and Visualization:</br>
o Visualize the EEG data and model predictions. Create plots and graphs to illustrate
your findings.
